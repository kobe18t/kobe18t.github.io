    <p> The dragon capsule is a pod designed by spacex which carries cargo and more recently people to and from the ISS (International Space Station). The dragon capsule has gone through numerous design changes and versions. The first of which being dragon one or more commonly known as cargo dragon which was capable of flying cargo and resources to the ISS and come back to earth and splash down in the ocean. However the next version of dragon would be able to carry even more payload and be able to carry humans to the ISS. The history of the creation of the dragon spacecraft is very interesting. In 2005 Elon Musk was frantically trying to gather funds from investors to launch one last rocket. Previous launches ended in catastrophic failure and this was going to be the last flight if it was not successful. Luckily the mission was a success and Elon Musk received a call from NASA asking to design a cargo service for the ISS at a price of 278 million dollars. Spacex completed all the necessary requirements and was rewarded with a 1.6 billion dollar contract to resupply the ISS and had potential increased funding worth more than 3.1 billion dollars. This saved the company from bankruptcy - which they were very close too during the unsuccessful falcon 1 launches - and paved the way for the future of Spacex with the falcon 9, falcon heavy, and starship programs.</p>
