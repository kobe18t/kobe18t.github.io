<!-- this is the code that lets you see the starship/superheavy -->
    <div class="text1">
      <p>Starship is the brainchild of Spacex founder and CEO Elon Musk. Starship is still in development and is slated to start flying to orbit with starship by the end of 2020. The starship will be mankind's first gateway to space colonization with Elon Musk wanting to use the starship to propel us into the future and will enable us to colonize other planets in our solar system. The starship will comprise two fully reusable stages which will both have the ability of landing using it’s engines, similar to what the falcon 9 does. The upper stage is called the starship, it can sometimes be confusing because starship is the name of the whole spaceship and the name of the upper stage. The starship will be 9m in diameter, 50m long,  The starship will be able to land the same as the falcon 9 and superheavy The lower stage is called the super heavy booster and will carry the upper stage to orbit and will have the ability to come back to earth and refuel and reused. Spacex has not yet made a prototype of the super heavy booster but has started to develop a prototype. The superheavy will be taller than the current falcon 9 and twice as powerful as the saturn 5, the rocket that took us to the moon. Super heavy will live up to its name and be 72m in length, 9m in diameter, and a total liftoff mass of 3,680,000kg. As of the 6th of september 2020 there have been seven prototype starships. The first being named ‘starhopper’ the second third, fourth and fifth being called mk 1, mk 2, mk3, and mk 4 with mk 1 being pictured right here. The next group of prototypes which have bigger tanks and are said to have more raptor engines are the serial number 5 and 6 which have both completed 150m hops with sn 7 and 8 being built and stacked</p>
